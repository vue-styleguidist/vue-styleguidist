/*
We’re not using Webpack loader resolver because its behavior can be changed by user‘s Webpack config (Create React App
does that for example). This way we can bypass Webpack resolver and just use Node resolver. Should be used like this:
require('!!../../../loaders/style-loader!../../../loaders/css-loader!codemirror/lib/codemirror.css');
